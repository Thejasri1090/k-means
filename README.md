# K-means Clustering

## Introduction

Implemented the K-means algorithm for image compression by reducing the number of colors that occur in an image to only those that are most common in that image.

## Implementation

The K-means algorithm was implemented for image compression. Steps included implementing K-means, apply K-means to a sample dataset, random initialization and image compression.
